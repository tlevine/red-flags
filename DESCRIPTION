Title: Identify red flags of fraud and corruption in projects financed by the
    World Bank
Description: The Integrity Vice Presidency of the World Bank
    has a list of red flags of fraud and corruption in procurement
    in bank-financed projects. These red flags are signs that
    fraud and corruption might be happening and may thus be a
    reason to conduct further investigation. The present package
    represents these red flags quantitatively in order that we
    may identify these red flags more systematically.
